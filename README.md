# Graphic-Stuff

This is a repository for sharing graphical codes I write ( e.g. python turtle , etc ) and/or renders I make ( Blender , C4D , etc ).

I'll try to add interesting things and possibly instructions every once in a while.

I hope that you find the things I post useful or at least enjoyable.

And lastly , any contributions , ideas , suggestions and critiques would be really appreciated.
